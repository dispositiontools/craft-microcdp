 * Cdpcookies Record
 *
 * ActiveRecord is the base class for classes representing relational data in terms of objects.
 *
 * Active Record implements the [Active Record design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record).
 * The premise behind Active Record is that an individual [[ActiveRecord]] object is associated with a specific
 * row in a database table. The object's attributes are mapped to the columns of the corresponding table.
 * Referencing an Active Record attribute is equivalent to accessing the corresponding table column for that record.
